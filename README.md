# GNCore Library
GNCore is a gn library that defines helper templates for generic gn projects. I developed this with the goal of reducing
the amount of repeated work that I have to do for my projects.
Some of the choices or the design may not be general enough, I am happy to accept contributions or other forms of feedback.
The code is MIT licensed so feel free to fork and modify it.

## Repo setup
To start working on a fresh clone, run
